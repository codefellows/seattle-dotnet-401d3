# Binary Tree

Reflecting back on the Binary Tree lecture in class, implement a Binary Tree within Visual Studio. 

A Visual Example of a Binary tree is located in the Assets Folder of this directory. 
<br />
The example code we created in class is in the Examples folder in this directory. 


Please implement the following:
1. Pre-order, InOrder, PostOrder

Manually add nodes to your tree and conduct each of the traversals on your tree. 
Your unit tests should prove the order of the output is expected


Your final project should have
1. Node class, 
2. Tree class
3. Program Class.


## Stretch
1. .Add(Node node) - adds a node to the Binary Tree
