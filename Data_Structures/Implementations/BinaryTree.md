# Binary Tree

Reflecting back on the Binary Tree lecture in class, implement a Binary Tree within Visual Studio. 

A Visual Example of a Binary tree is located in the Assets Folder of this directory. 
<br />
The example code we created in class is in the Examples folder in this directory. 

1. .Add(Node node) - adds a node to the Binary Tree
1. Pre-order, InOrder, PostOrder

Your final project should have
1. Node class, 
2. Tree class
3. Program Class.


Implement a Tree with multiple nodes and output each of the traversals in your `Main()` Method. 

Be sure to create unit tests to prove your tree is working as expected.
