# Stacks and Queues

Reflecting back on the stacks and queue lecture in class, implement both a stack and a queue within Visual Studio. 
Implement a `Stack` and a `Queue` with the following methods:

#### Stack
1. Push(Node node)
2. Pop() // Returns and removes Node
3. Peek(); // Returns a reference to a Node

#### Queue
1. Endqueue(Node node)
2. Dequeue() // Returns and removes Node
3. Peek(); // Returns a reference to a Node

Your final project should have
1. Node class, 
1. Stack class
1. Queue class
1. Program Class.

Be sure to test your stack adn queue using Unit Tests as well to prove that the requirements above are met.
