![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Implementation: Insertion Sort
=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment

- Within your `Data_Structures and Algorithms` repo, add a new directory named `Sorting_Algorithms`, 
- Add/Commit/Push your implementation to the new directory you just created. 
- Create your own technical documentation for your new implmenetaion. Explain to your audience what the data structure is, how you implemented it, and what 
type of uses you would use this for. 
- Inside the DSA readme doc, add on the your table of contents a link to the readme of your newly created DS.  

## Directions

Implement an Insertion Sort

## Resources
1. Visit the Visualgo site below
1. select "INSERTION SORT" located on the top navigation
1. Select "GO"
1. Pay attention to the PsuedoCode located in the bottom right corner
- [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)

## Specs
1. Create a method named `InsertionsSort` that takes an unsorted array. 
1. Within `Main`, Output the console the contents of the unsorted array
1. Conduct the insertion sort
1. return the sorted array
1. Output to the console the contents of the sorted array 

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in implementation directions

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing tests // tests are not passing // not enough valid tests |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
